      "Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, members of Congress, and the American people, thank you so much for your extraordinary leadership in this difficult time. I want to thank all of you for the extraordinary work that you do each and every day to keep us safe and secure in the event of a nuclear-armed North Korea. As I said before, the United States is prepared to use all elements of our power to protect our people and our allies, including our nuclear weapons. And we will do so in a manner that is consistent with international law and international norms, as well as the principle of non-proliferation -- a principle that recognizes the right of all nations to determine their own nuclear program and to pursue peaceful nuclear energy. That is why I have directed the Secretary of State, John Kerry, to convene a meeting of my national security team this week to discuss the situation in South Korea and how we can work with the international community to resolve this issue diplomatically and legally. We will work closely with our international partners to make sure that we are meeting our obligations under the Nuclear Non-Approved Framework Agreement, which is the basis for all U.N. Security Council\n"
